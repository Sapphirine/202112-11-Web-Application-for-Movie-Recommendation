# 202112-11-Web-Application-for-Movie-Recommendation
Downloading the dataset and run the Run.ipynb can be time-consuming. We hard-coded two examples of our results:
1. Open the recommend.html file under ~\src\main\resources\templates
2. Input "Frozen" or "Titanic" to test the result

To run the entire application: 
1. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset to the same path as Run.ipynb
2. Run Run.ipynb until all the cells have done the job
3. Open the recommend.html file under ~\src\main\resources\templates
